# Math-Snake

To play the game open main.py file and execute the code.

The game is made for prectising pygame library in python. Furthermore, this project can be improved to help elemetary school children to enhance their calculating skills. The game is not very complex and can be written in a couple of hours, so my goal is writing the code in a proper way to make the code easy to read. To do that I used comment lines and separated the codes of the different part of the game.
In the game, because of my main goal was not working on graphics (do not have not much time for that), there can be some visiual bugs when the snake teleport from the borders. Also, the snake does not have a tail, that is due to the same reason as I said earlier.
The game is very similar to classical snake game. Our goal is eating the appropriate apple which can be determined by calculating the result of the given problem. If you eat correct one other apples and a question appear and it goes like that. However, if you eat wrong apple, you do not die but a barrier appear in a random place and if you hit it you lose. Other than that, gameplay is the same as classical snake game. Each time you earn a point, the game is becoming harder and after some scores the number of apple, and the type of operation changes
